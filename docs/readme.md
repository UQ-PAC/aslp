# ASLp documentation

This folder will provide documentation for ASLp,
primarily of interest to developers of ASLp and
people seeking to integrate ASLp.

ASLp is a partial evaluator for the ARM specification language.
The most established functionality is in the [online partial evaluation](./online.md).
The new [offline partial evaluation](./offline.md), building on the online features,
is available for easier integration with projects.

The project is validated by a number of [tests](./testing.md) which are run
on pushes and merge requests to the repository.
